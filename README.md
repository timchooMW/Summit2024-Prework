3. Download Git binary from Mathworks Software Center and install it if you don't have it

4. Use `git clone https://github.com/yuxudong1024/Summit2024-Prework` command to clone this repo, you can create a folder like git in your one drive to put all your repos there.

5.  Goto the folder you have the repo has been cloned, in the MATLAB command window, run `mex convec.c` to compile a mex file. If it works, then you can go to next step, if that fails, you need to install MATLAB compiler and MinGW compiler if you didn't do so. You can do it though MATLAB Add-Ons. ![MinGW](MinGW.png) ![Compiler](Compiler.png)
